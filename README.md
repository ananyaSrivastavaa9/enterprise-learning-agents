# 🤖 Enterprise Learning Agents
### Multi-Agent Reasoning System | Microsoft Agents League Hackathon 2026
**Track: Reasoning Agents | Built with Microsoft Foundry + GitHub Models**

## 🧠 What It Does

Enterprise Learning Agents is a multi-agent AI reasoning system that acts as a
corporate learning advisor for employees at Contoso Cloud Solutions.

An employee provides their job role. The system's Supervisor Agent orchestrates
a chain of three specialized AI agents that reason over a real enterprise policy
document and produce a fully personalized certification and study plan.

**No hardcoded answers. Every response is reasoned, grounded, and role-specific.**

## 🤖 Agent Breakdown

| Agent | Role | File | 
|---|---|---| 
| Supervisor | Orchestrates the full reasoning loop | `supervisor.py` | 
| Policy Agent | Reads enterprise JSON, extracts role requirements | `agents/policy_agent.py` | 
| Study Planner Agent | Builds weekly schedule within capacity constraints | `agents/study_planner_agent.py` | 
| Memory Agent | Aggregates all outputs into final polished response | `memory/memory_agent.py` |

## 💡 Microsoft IQ Integration

This project uses **Foundry IQ** — the agentic knowledge retrieval layer —
by grounding all agent responses in a real enterprise policy document
(`corporate_learning_policy.json`). No agent hallucinates requirements.
Every certification, skill, and schedule constraint is sourced directly
from the policy, reducing hallucination and enforcing enterprise accuracy.

Save the file. Then run this to do a final clean test of the whole system:
bashpython supervisor.py
Type Cloud Application Developer when prompted. Paste the output — if it runs clean, we move to the architecture diagram and submission checklist.
